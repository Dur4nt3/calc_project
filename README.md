# Calculator Project

### Calculator Project | The Odin Project | Foundations

This is the final project of the foundations course of "The Odin Project".

After all basic front-end development concepts, the main goal of this project is to put it all together.

**Skills demonstrated:Basic HTML, Basic CSS, Basic JavaScript**

**Webpage responsiveness:THIS PROJECT WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON A MOBILE PHONE**

### Note: 

The calculator within the webpage isn't a scientific calculator, it is a basic calculator that takes two operands and an operator and returns the result of the expression.

**This project DOESN'T use the "eval()" function or "new Function()" to evaluate the mathematical expression; the aforementioned methods are susceptible to XSS injections when not implemented correctly.**[^1]

[^1]: Although XSS within the confines of this project might not be as severe (as there is no functionality for user authentication), it is still a good practice to steer clear of highly vulnerable coding practices, therefore, I will not use the aforementioned practices.
